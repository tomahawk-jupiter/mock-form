# Mock form

From the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/forms).

Build a browser form which collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields.

## Should Include

1. **Live inline validation:** Highlight and display message until field filled in correctly. When a user leaves a field it should be automatically validated.

2. **Error message with invalid form submission:** If any active errors or missing required fields.

## Notes

Turn off browser auto validate:

    <form novalidate>
